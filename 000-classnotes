Year 1 CSE @ NTU(Nanyang technological university) @ Singapore
Year 1 - 1st Sem finished

Year 1 - 2nd Sem - C & CPP

Why C?
How, When, Where

1. The OS X kernel is written mostly in C. Every program and driver in a Mac runs on a C-powered kernel. 

2. Microsoft Windows is primarily written in C and C++

3. The Python interpreter, called CPython, is written in the C programming language. Python borrows some syntax from C, but it uses whitespace to organize code, which makes it easier to read. 

4. "Most of the Software in Tesla cars is C or C++,"

5. "No programming language has come close to C or C++ when it comes to efficiency.

6. If you want to work for companies dealing with hardware such as NASA, SpaceX, Intel, Tesla or Nvidia, forget about the Javascript framework, and aim for C!

7. One of the Oldest Language, But still ruling the Industry

8. Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database written in C and C++.

9. Today, most programmers who write device drivers work either in the C or C++ programming languages because they offer excellent access to low-level instructions along with more complex program and data structures.

10. Unix is written primarily in the C programming language. 

Software Companies:
-------------------
1. Product Based
   Google - Google Maps
   Google - chrome
   Google - Andoird
   Microsft - Windows OS, Office 365
   Facebook, amazon etc

   C, CPP, DS using C, DSA using CPP

2. Service Based
   Tech Stack - Java stack, Python Stack, MERN Stack
   Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra etc....

   ICICI --> Infosys
   Client of Infosys

   Technology & Domain
   Java         Banking


What is Computer?

Input --> Processes --> Output


Sequence instructions --> Programming

Programming Language --> Tool ---> to write programs

Communicate --> for performing tasks

Human Communication --> Natural Languages --> English, Telugu, Hindi

Human to Machine Communication --> Programming Languages --> C,CPP,Java,Python etc

Programming = Solving Problems using Computers


Steps in programming:
1. logic
2. coding
3. translate (Compiler/interepter)
4. Execution

Algorithm: Step by Step Approach to solve a Program

Algorithm is Expressed in two ways:
1. Pseudocode
2. Flowchart

-----------------------------
Introduction to C Language
Writing First Program in C Language - Hello Welcome

-----------------------------
Day 4:
Date: 10th Dec 2024
-----------------------------
Varaibles, Datatypes and Reading Input

What is Variable?
name of the memory location

What is datatype?
specifies what type of data, that a variable will hold

what is byte?
it is memory measurement unit

What is keyword?
it is an reserved word, with some specific meaning defined by the 
language compiler

what is constant?
something which is fixed, which cannot change is known as constant

ex:
int age = 20;

int - datatype
age - variable
= - assignment operators
20 - integer constant 
; - special symbol


What is memory?
it is the place, where data is stored.

What is compiler?
Compiler is a special software, which translates our source code into machine code


-----------------------------
Day 5:
Date: 11th Dec 2024
-----------------------------
Write a Program to swap the values of two variables A and B.

Mr.Ravi is flying from Rajahmundry to delhi, he got into flight from Rajahmundry Madhurapudi airport, after bording into the flight, the flight attendent/pilot announced that the flyging time to reach delhi is 230 minutes.
write a c program to convert the the flying time in hours and minutes

Input:
basic_salary
allowances
deductions

Process(logic):
grosssalary = basic_salary + allowances
netsalary = grosssalary - deductions

Output:
grossSalary
netSalary

Note: Technical Knowledge + Domain Knowledge

char - %c - 1 character

char gender;



------------
Assignments:
------------
1.Write a C Program to Display Your Current Address
2.Write a C Program to read marks of C,Java & Python and calculate total and average 
Note: total and average varaibes must be declared as real numbers

3. Write a Program to swap the values of two variables A and B without using 3rd varaible.
4. Write a program to read the temprature in Fahrenheit and convert it 
   into Celsius.
   To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, use the following formula:
   °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
5. WAP to calculate Electricity bill from the input present month and 
   last month reading.
   Note: Rate per unit is 2.50

6. Program to calculate gross salary and net salary from the input basic salary, allowances and deductions.

7. Write a Program to read gender of person(m/f) and display the same

8. Write a Program to read full name, gender and city of a person
   full name - multiple words(first name, middle name and last name) - %[^\n]
   gender - %c
   city - %s
