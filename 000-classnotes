Day 1:
Date: 5th Dec 2024
-------------------
Year 1 CSE @ NTU(Nanyang technological university) @ Singapore
Year 1 - 1st Sem finished

Year 1 - 2nd Sem - C & CPP
----------------------------
Course: C Programming
Beginner to Advanced

----------------------------
Why C?
How, When, Where

1. The OS X kernel is written mostly in C. Every program and driver in a Mac runs on a C-powered kernel. 

2. Microsoft Windows is primarily written in C and C++

3. The Python interpreter, called CPython, is written in the C programming language. Python borrows some syntax from C, but it uses whitespace to organize code, which makes it easier to read. 

4. "Most of the Software in Tesla cars is C or C++,"

5. "No programming language has come close to C or C++ when it comes to efficiency.

6. If you want to work for companies dealing with hardware such as NASA, SpaceX, Intel, Tesla or Nvidia, forget about the Javascript framework, and aim for C!

7. One of the Oldest Language, But still ruling the Industry

8. Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database written in C and C++.

9. Today, most programmers who write device drivers work either in the C or C++ programming languages because they offer excellent access to low-level instructions along with more complex program and data structures.

10. Unix is written primarily in the C programming language. 

Software Companies:
-------------------

What is Computer?

Input --> Processes --> Output


Sequence instructions --> Programming

Programming Language --> Tool ---> to write programs

Communicate --> for performing tasks

Human Communication --> Natural Languages --> English, Telugu, Hindi

Human to Machine Communication --> Programming Languages --> C,CPP,Java,Python etc

Programming = Solving Problems using Computers


Steps in programming:
1. logic
2. coding
3. translate (Compiler/interepter)
4. Execution

Varaibles, Datatypes and Reading Input

What is Variable?
name of the memory location

What is datatype?
specifies what type of data, that a variable will hold

what is byte?
it is memory measurement unit

What is keyword?
it is an reserved word, with some specific meaning defined by the 
language compiler

what is constant?
something which is fixed, which cannot change is known as constant

ex:
int age = 20;

int - datatype
age - variable
= - assignment operators
20 - integer constant 
; - special symbol


What is memory?
it is the place, where data is stored.

What is compiler?
Compiler is a special software, which translates our source code into machine code
